Apps → Shell → Kernel → Hardware

Remember "ASK"

Hardware Layer (bottom): Includes physical hardware. The kernel directly manages these resources.  

Kernel: The core program that communicates with hardware. 
Shell commands talk to the kernel, which then controls the hardware.  

Shell: Acts as a gateway between you (user) and the kernel. It's a terminal interface where you type shell commands (like mkdir) to instruct the kernel.  

Applications(top): Things like terminal, notepad, browsers, or other programs you run. These send requests through the shell to the kernel.
